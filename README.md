# Why?

I love svelte as it's so compact and easy. However, I couldn't get IPFS to work with Rollup, so I needed to stick to Webpack. I found it was pretty hard to get the right webpack config to get IPFS running. Once I found the rght magic formula, decided to save it here.

Now you can benefit from it too!
